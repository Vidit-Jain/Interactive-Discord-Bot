Don't be such an insecure imbecile. You can just ask for !help if you don't know how to talk to a bot.
You can't even give commands to a bot, how the hell are you gonna write programs in college? Shame.
Stop asking about the gender ratio of the college when you can't even converse properly in text.
Learn how to type you braindead idiot! Can't believe you made it till here in life with a pea-sized brain.
